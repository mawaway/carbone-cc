============

### What's Carbone-cc?

Carbone-cc (Carbone-carboncopy) is a fork of [carbone-ng](https://github.com/Calinou/carbone-ng).
It is a subgame for Minetest. Carbone-cc was created by mawaway 
and can be found [here](https://github.com/mawaway/carbone-cc). Although
"carboncopy" is in the name, this subgame is not an exact copy of Carbone-ng.
If you would like a working version of Carbone-ng (working on Minetest-0.5) see
[this commit](https://github.com/mawaway/carbone-cc/commit/3d49d79b6c80a52644d09459a1c373d34c1db6d9).
