Carbone-ng-fixed
============

### What's this?

This is a working version of Carbone-ng. The only change is the menu
artwork and mods/default/functions.lua to fix a call to a changed Minetest 
function. 

If you want an updated Carbone (updated, and newer different mods) see
[Carbone-cc](https://github.com/mawaway/carbone-cc).
